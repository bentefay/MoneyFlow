# MoneyFlow

[MoneyFlow](https://moneyflow.azurewebsites.net/) tracks how your money flows in, around, and out of your various banks and accounts. 

## :page_facing_up: Single view of all your finances 

View all your transactions in a single view, consolidating many banks and accounts. 
Get the benefits of a modern, beautiful spend tracking without being tied to a particular bank. 
Tag and filter to your hearts content. 

## :couple: Manage shared finances 

Track ownership of spending when you share your accounts with someone you :heart:

## :ledger: Know what you're spending money on 

Categorise and visualize your spending, and MoneyFlow will learn over time to do this for you automatically.

## :lock: Safe and secure by design

You own your data. Your data is encrypted, end-to-end, so nobody can access it but you. 

## :inbox_tray: Simple data import

Data import is designed to be painless without comprimising your security. Visit your bank's online banking website 
as you normally would, then either:
1. Copy and paste straight out of the web page. 
2. Download CSV files of your transactions and upload them to MoneyFlow. 
3. In the future, a desktop app will do this for you automatically 
   (it will all be open source, so you can be sure nothing :fish: is going on)
